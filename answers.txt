3 Types of meetings that happen on a sprint cycle:

    Daily Scrum/Standup Meeting:
        ▪ Short meeting that happens every day of the sprint
        ▪ Usually, 10 mins long
        ▪ Team members discuss work completed, work plan for the day and any blockers
    Sprint Retrospective Meeting:
        ▪ Occurs at the end of the sprint
        ▪ Discuss work complete and move incomplete work to backlog
        ▪ Close sprint

Difference between Epic, Story, Bug, and Task:

        ▪ Captures a large body of work that can be broken down into several
        smaller stories

        ▪ A software system requirement that is expressed in a few short
        sentences and is part of the epic
    Bug:
